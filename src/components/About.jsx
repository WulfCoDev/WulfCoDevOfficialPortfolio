                    <p className="font-tertiary text-white text-[18px] mb-6">I am a Web Developer with a background in IT/Tech repair and have over a decade of graphic design experience. I am seeking remote opportunities as a Web Developer or Software Engineer.</p>
                    <p className="font-tertiary text-white text-[18px] mb-6">What drew me to web development is the ability to express my creativity whilst leveraging my design skills from my graphic design experience. On the other hand, web development succumbs my need for problem-solving and constant self-evolution; growth.</p>
                    <p className="font-tertiary text-white text-[18px] mb-6">In my free time, you can find me sim-racing or just hanging out with friends on Discord. I also enjoy making 3D prints and other things such as custom stickers, clothes, etc.</p>
